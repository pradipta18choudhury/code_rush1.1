/******

Today you will learn about COMBO-ATTACKS. Two or more heroes can perform a Combo-Attack by attacking together at an opponent. 
When they attack together their total attack power is product of their individual attack powers.
For example Batman, Superman and Green Lantern have attack powers 10, 5, 2 resp. 
then attack powers of combo-attack (Batman and Superman) is 50 (Batman and GL) is 20 and all of them together is 100.

Input
The first line of input contains integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The next line consists of n space seperated integers a[i] the attack powers of n superheroes
(for all i 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7).

Output
Print the final answer modulo (10^9 + 7).
You are a big superhero fan and want to calculate sum of all possible attacks that N superheroes can perform given their attack powers, 
i.e. sum of all individual attacks + sum of all combo attacks.
As the resulting number can be large calculate it modulo (10^9 + 7).

SAMPLE INPUT 
3
10 5 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
197
Explanation
Attack powers of all possible attacks = 10+5+2+50+10+20+100
